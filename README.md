CS465-Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The front end of the website used a combination of html and javascript. It also incorporated dynamic page definitions by storing the pages in the database, allowing for easy changes and additions. The SPA was a simple bare bones page that focused on providing admin functions for easy website maintenence and updates.The backend used a nosql database because it required versitile schemas and documents which might not have a completely rigid structure, like in a SQL database. 

Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is notation for describing specific instances of java objects. Javascript is a scripting language used for sending commands to cpu. Javascript controls the objects and JSON represents them individually for storage. Certian page content was represented by JSON documents in the database, this allowed for pages to be more dynamic and easier to update and maintain.

Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Most of the testing for this application was using postman to send requests and verifying the returned the correct responses. Adding authentication to this process meant that request and retrival methods must only be possible after authentication.

Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

I now clearly grasp the concept of what exactly full stack development means. Before this class this that term was just a fancy qualification I saw on jobs in my field. Being able to add this course to my resume will improve my chances of getting jobs which list fullstack as a desired skill.
